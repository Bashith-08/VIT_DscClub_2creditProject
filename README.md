TITLE :    Interpretation of  Aircraft Wildlife Strikes in the Years 1990-2015.
                  
INTRODUCTION :
     A wildlife strike is a collision between an animal (most often a bird, but sometimes another species) and a man-made vehicle, especially aircraft. Wildlife strikes constitute a serious hazard to aircraft safety and have caused a number of fatal accidents.
     The Federal Aviation Authority counted 177,269 wildlife strike reports on civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, growing 38% in seven years from 2009 to 2015. Birds accounted for 97%. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
       This is a machine learning project. This project is about to analyze the information and to find which kind of species are damaging aircraft more and which part of aircraft is getting more damaged. The dataset consists an information of each reported wildlife birds strike of a military, industrial, or civil planes between 1990 and 2015. Each row describes information about the incident date, plane operator, plane make and version, engine make and type, airport name and location, species names and quantity, plane strikes and plane damage.
Dataset Link :
Given below is a Kaggle dataset of Aircraft Wildlife Strikes in the years 1990-2015.
       Link: https://www.kaggle.com/faa/wildlife-strikes

As described above, this dataset  has 66 features related to the damage caused to airplanes and the species of bird that caused the damage.
Find the answers to the following questions.
1.	What bird species has caused the most damage to airplanes?
2.	Which part of the airplane is most prone to damage in wildlife strikes?

OBJECTIVES :
●	Use data visualization tools to understand and analyze the data better.
●	Feature selection is the key here - not all 66 features are relevant to the problem so select only those that you need to train your model. 
●	Data Science is not about building models, it is about solving problems  by using / analyzing data.
